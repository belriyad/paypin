## 🎯 Usage Limits & Feature Gates

const features = subscription.features;

if (customers.length >= features.maxCustomers) {
  // Show upgrade prompt
  showUpgradeDialog('customer_limit');
}

if (monthlyReminders >= features.maxReminders) {
  // Block reminder sending
  showUpgradeDialog('reminder_limit');
}
```

### Implementation Areas
