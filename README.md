# PayPing MVP Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and includes Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and React Router for a quick start on the PayPing application.

## Setup

Run `npm install` after cloning the repository to install dependencies.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the development server
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint checks
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build

## Structure

- `src/pages` — basic page components like `LandingPage`, `SignupPage`, and `Dashboard`
- `src/components` — reusable UI components
- `src/contexts` — React context providers like `AuthContext`
- `src/firebase.js` — Firebase initialization (replace config with your credentials)

This is only a starting point and does not include backend integrations or full functionality.
