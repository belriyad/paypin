# Customer Data Management - FIXED ✅

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: When adding a new customer, the data was not being saved.

**Root Cause**: The Customers page was using hardcoded data instead of the AppDataContext for data management.

## Changes Made

## How Data is Now Saved

### **Data Flow**
1. **User fills out form** → Form data stored in component state
2. **User clicks "Add Customer"** → `addCustomer()` called with form data
3. **AppDataContext receives data** → useReducer processes ADD_CUSTOMER action
4. **Data added to state** → New customer added with unique ID and timestamps
5. **localStorage updated** → useEffect automatically saves to localStorage
6. **UI updates** → Customer appears in table immediately

### **Data Persistence**
- ✅ **localStorage**: All data automatically saved to browser storage
- ✅ **Auto-generated IDs**: Uses `Date.now()` for unique customer IDs
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Automatic `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Basic form validation before saving

### **Data Structure**
```javascript
{
  id: 1690123456789,
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com", 
  phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567",
  company: "Acme Corp",
  totalOwed: 1500.00,
  overdueAmount: 500.00,
  status: "overdue",
  remindersEnabled: true,
  lastPayment: "2025-07-28",
  paymentHistory: 0,
  createdAt: "2025-07-28T...",
  updatedAt: "2025-07-28T..."
